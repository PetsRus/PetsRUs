      <h1>Our Story:</h1>
      <p>Pets R Us originally started with a humble farmer Rupert G. Schmedlap and a barn in 2008. Mr. Schmedlap. Rupert
        always had a love for animals and took in strays and unwanted farm animals whenever he could. Rubert wanted to
        share the joy of having animals with his community, so he bought some land and built what is now PetsRUs. With
        the support of donations from the community, PetsRUs has been able to place more than 200 animals in forever
        homes.</p>
