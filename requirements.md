## Product vision
- To create a feature rich website that allows users to select what pets they want to adopt, communicate to the adoption clinic, and provide their contact information (email/phone/etc) for clear communication on what pets they want to adopt/see before physically coming to the clinic.  



## Pain point this project solves
- Allows the adoption clinic to prep animals on a schedule that will be seen/adopted day of.  Allows the user to see what pets are available at the adoption clinic before they physically leave their homes.  



## The why behind our product
- Give employees/volunteers at adoption clinics more time to care for animals rather than deal with scheduling or frequent questions that can be answered using a website and not via phone calls for information. 


### Scope (In/Out)
- IN - What will your product do
  - website will have welcome prompt and asks user for contact info (email)
  - users can navigate to animal page where they can select which pets (by type) they want to adopt, this will move selected animals to the cart page automatically
  - provide an about me page that shows all employees and developers of site
  - users can "checkout" their cart of animals they selected for adoption, this will forward their request to the clinic employees with contact information


- OUT - What will your product not do.
  - website will not turn into an IOS or android app, will only display on webpages
  - no advanced math calculations (adoption price, taxes, merch, etc.)
